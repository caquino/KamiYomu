# KamiYomu

**KamiYomu** is a powerful, extensible manga crawler built for manga enthusiasts who want full control over their collection. It scans and downloads manga from supported websites, stores them locally, and lets you host your own private manga reader—no ads, no subscriptions, no limits.

Whether you're cataloging rare series, powering a personal manga dashboard, or seeking a cleaner alternative to bloated online readers, KamiYomu puts you in control of how you access and organize manga content. It’s a lightweight, developer-friendly crawler built for clarity, extensibility, and respectful use of publicly accessible sources. Content availability and usage rights depend on the licensing terms of each source — KamiYomu simply provides the tools.
