## 📋 Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

## 📦 Getting Started

1. Save the following `docker-compose.yml` file in a directory:

```yml
services:
  kamiyomu:
    image: marcoscostadev/kamiyomu:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080/healthz"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
    volumes:
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro # Sync time with host
      - kamiyomu_manga:/manga
      - kamiyomu_database:/db
      - kamiyomu_agents:/agents
      - kamiyomu_logs:/logs
volumes:
  kamiyomu_manga:
  kamiyomu_database:
  kamiyomu_agents:
  kamiyomu_logs:
```

2. Run the following command in the directory containing `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

3. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:8080`


## 🌐 Public API & OPDS Catalog

KamiYomu provides external access to your collection via a public API and the OPDS (Open Publication Distribution System) standard.

### 📚 OPDS Catalog
To access your library on mobile devices, e-readers, or third-party apps (like Moon+ Reader or KyBook), use the following endpoint:

`http://localhost:8080/public/api/v1/opds`

**Note:** If accessing from a different device, replace `localhost` with your server's local IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.50`).

---

### 🛠 Interactive API Documentation (Swagger)

For developers or users wishing to interact with the system programmatically, a full Swagger UI is available to explore all endpoints:

`http://localhost:8080/public/api/swagger/index.html`

---

### ⚠️ Network Configuration
To access these services from outside the host machine:
* **Firewall:** Ensure that port `8080` (or your custom mapped port) is open in your system's firewall.
* **Remote Access:** If accessing over the internet, ensure you have configured port forwarding or a reverse proxy. 
* **Security:** It is highly recommended to use a VPN or a reverse proxy with SSL (HTTPS) if exposing these endpoints publicly.

> [!NOTE]
> Map volumes to local paths as needed. Check [releases](https://github.com/KamiYomu/releases) for available versions.

* **Task Orchestration:** Schedules and manages agent tasks such as searching, listing, and fetching metadata.
* **Image Acquisition:** Downloads images directly from sources identified by the crawler agents.
* **Local Archiving:** Automatically organizes downloaded images into structured archives within your specified directories.
* **Flexible Exporting:** Allows you to export your collection as PDF, CBZ, or ZIP files for offline use.
* **Library Management:** Provides a sleek, self-hosted web interface optimized for both desktop and mobile browsing.

### ❌ What KamiYomu Does Not

**Security & Data Integrity**
* **Exploit or Invade:** Never bypasses security measures, exploits vulnerabilities, or circumvents paywalls/access controls.

* **Data Collection:** Does not collect, monitor, or store any personal data, metadata, or activity on central servers.

**Content & Distribution**

* **Peer-to-Peer Sharing:** Does not support P2P sharing, inter-instance communication, or commercial redistribution.

**Legal & Liability**
* **Endorsement:** Does not support, condone, or assist in bypassing legal restrictions or copyright infringement.
