## 🚀 Why KamiYomu?

Whether you're cataloging rare series, powering a personal manga dashboard, or seeking a cleaner alternative to bloated online readers, KamiYomu puts you in control of how you access and organize manga content. It’s a lightweight, developer-friendly crawler built for clarity, extensibility, and respectful use of publicly accessible sources. Content availability and usage rights depend on the licensing terms of each source — KamiYomu simply provides the tools.

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)


## 📦 Getting Started

save the following `docker-compose.yml` file to run KamiYomu with Docker:

```yml
services:
    kamiyomu:
      image: marcoscostadev/kamiyomu:1.0.0-beta2
      ports:
        - "8080:8080" # HTTP Port
      envelopment:
        - Settings__Worker__WorkerCount=3 # Number of concurrent crawler agents excecuting
      restart: unless-stopped
      healthcheck:
        test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "https://localhost:8080/healthz"]
        interval: 30s
        timeout: 10s
        retries: 3
      volumes:
        - ./AppData/manga:/manga # Your desired local path for manga storage 
        - Kamiyomu_database:/db
        - kamiyomu_agents:/agents 
        - kamiyomu_logs:/logs 

volumes:
      kamiyomu_agents:
      Kamiyomu_database:
      kamiyomu_logs:
```

In the folder where you saved the `docker-compose.yml` file, run:

```bash
    docker-compose up -d
```
You will have access to the web interface at `http://localhost:8080`.
Keep in mind to map the volumes to your desired local paths. 
See the releases branchs for identifying the versions available.

Configure your sources and crawler agents
